overview
--------


lns.http is a pure Lisp web server that is based on lisp-network-server.

lisp-network-server handles listening on the network, accepting the
connection and creating a new thread with your code running in it.

lns.http then implements the webserver on top of it.

requirements
------------

lns.http requires a sufficiently recent (0.9.4 works)
version of SBCL with:
 - SB-THREAD (check *features*)
 - SB-BSD-SOCKETS (see (require :sb-bsd-sockets))
Currently, this means that you need to run the whole stack on a Linux 2.6
kernel due to the requirements for SB-THREAD, but work for supporting
SB-THREAD for SBCL on Solaris is supposed to be under way and SB-THREAD
might work on FreeBSD too.

It also requires lisp-network-server.
